Repository cleaned on 2025-11-04 to start fresh. Only Git metadata was preserved. Use this repository to create your new project. 

Recommended next steps:
- Add your new project files (they will be tracked by Git).
- Update this README with the new project description.

If you want, I can scaffold a new project template for you (for example: .NET console, ASP.NET, Node.js, Python).
